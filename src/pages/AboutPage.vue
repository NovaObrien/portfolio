      Letter of Recommendation
      I am pleased to write a letter of recommendation for Nova O'Brien, holding a Certificate of Completion for the Full Stack Immersive Course from CodeWorks. It was an honor to be his primary instructor on his journey to becoming a developer.
      I enjoyed our discussions for solutions on the many challenges he was able to overcome and I was impressed by the completion of stretch goals on assignments. Nova always demonstrated a calm demeanor and eagerness to learn, including a drive to push beyond what was the minimum expectation. He was thoughtful, professional, and diligent when engaging with peers to accomplish their given tasks.
      Throughout the course, I can say he was able to bring success and value to the different teams and other students he worked with. I know he will continue to be a dedicated student and a competent professional. I recommend him without any reservations as I know him to be a highly skilled and qualified candidate for any developer position. Without a doubt his drive will bring success to any team he is on.
      Sincerely,
      Darryl Kilzer
